Executive Summary
This report presents a time series forecasting model built on U.S. monthly retail sales data from 2010 to 2024. The project leverages ARIMA to forecast the next 24 months of sales with the goal of providing forward-looking insight for financial planning and strategic decisions. Key deliverables include trend analysis, seasonal decomposition, model evaluation, and forecast visualization.

Dataset Overview
Source: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)
Series ID: RSXFS (Retail & Food Services Sales, Seasonally Adjusted)
Frequency: Monthly
Time Range: January 2014 – December 2024
Units: Millions USD

Methodology
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Plotted raw sales data with 3- and 6-month rolling averages
Performed additive seasonal decomposition
Assessed month-to-month changes

2. Stationarity Testing:
Conducted Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test
Differenced data once (d=1) to achieve stationarity

3. Modeling with ARIMA:
Used auto_arima() to select optimal parameters via AIC
Tuned across (p, d, q) values in the range (0–3)
Suppressed overfitting using stepwise search and error handling

4. Forecasting:
Forecasted 24 months into the future
Generated 95% confidence intervals
Used dynamic DatetimeIndex for forecasting range

5. Evaluation:
Analyzed residual patterns (mean-zero, no autocorrelation)
Calculated in-sample RMSE
Reviewed AIC value for model simplicity vs fit

Visuals
1. Forecast with Confidence Intervals
Displays actuals and predicted sales
Orange shaded area shows the 95% CI range

2. Seasonal Decomposition
Observed mixed seasons
COVID-era data showed suppressed holiday demand
Highlighted the limits of assumption-based forecasting

Key Metrics
Metric	Value (Example)
AIC	~2750
In-sample RMSE	~35190
Model Type	ARIMA(1,1,1)
Forecast Horizon	24 Months

Key Takeaways
Retail sales trend steadily upward with some seasonal behavior
Q4 “holiday spikes” are inconsistent — disrupted by economic shocks
External volatility (e.g., COVID-19, inflation) altered consumer trends
ARIMA modeling captured macro patterns and forecasted within stable bounds
Financial forecasting must be flexible and data-led — not assumption-based

Future Work
Apply SARIMA or Facebook Prophet for improved seasonality modeling
Integrate inflation or unemployment data as multivariate inputs
Implement walk-forward or rolling validation
Deploy interactive dashboard via Streamlit or Tableau
